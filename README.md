Script to forward all messages, videos, photoes, audios and documents from chat/group/channel/bot to chat/group/channel/bot of Telegram.

This is a script that forward automatically all messages, videos, photoes, audios and documents from Telegram chat/group/channel/bot to another chat/group/channel/bot.
It works 24/7 if you upload and run it in heroku or similar platform.

In the first use you need to set the "config.ini" file with your settings.
